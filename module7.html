<p>Let's explore slope-intercept form through four examples:

<p>The following interactive examples will help you step through how to find an equation and write it in slope-intercept form. 
  <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/equation_of_line.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <strong>You can review the basics and more examples via this free resource.</strong>

<h2>
  <strong>Example 1: Given the equation of a line in slope-intercept form, y = 3x + 4, what is the slope of the line, and what does it represent in the context of the problem?
  <ul>
      <li>We know from the prior module that in the form y = mx + b, m represents the slope or rate of change of y with respect to x.</li>
      <li>So, in this case, we can assume that the rate of change between y and x, in this case, would be m, which in this case would be 3.</li> 
      <li>For this example, let's use a graph to help determine the slope!</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Let's step through this by selecting two points from the graph (-3, -5) (1, 7).</strong>
   <ul>
      <li>Recall that m = y2 - y1 / x2 - x1 (which is also tangent of the angle of the formed triangle!).</li>
      <li>You can click the button below to reveal the steps to find the x-intercept</li>
  </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Slope (m) = the rate of change of y divided by the rate of change of x = 3.</li>
      <li>Step 2: The rate of change of x = 1 - (-3) = 4.</li>
      <li>Step 3: The rate of change of y = 7 - (-5) = 12.</li>
      <li>Result: Thus, 12 / 4 = 3. The slope of the line is 3 or m = 3.</li>

      <strong>Example 2: Let's now solve a fractional example from a given set of two points.</strong>

          <li>Find the equation of a line that passes through the points (-3, 1) and (2, 8).</li>

      </p>
      <h3>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Step 1: Recall that the slope (m) is given by the formula: m = (change in y) / (change in x)
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (8 - 1) / (2 - (-3)) = 7 / 5.</li>
          <li>Step 2: Choose one of the given points (x, y) to find the y-intercept (b). Let's use the point (2, 8) to find the y-intercept (b). </li>
          <li>Step 3: Write the equation in slope-intercept form using the found slope (m) and the y-intercept (b). y = (7/5)x + b. </li>
         <li>Step 4: Now, we need to find the value of "b". Since the line passes through the point (2, 8), we can substitute these values into the equation to find "b". </li>       
<li>Step 5: Solve for "b" using 8 = 14/5 + b. To get "b" alone, subtract 14/5 from both sides:
<ul>
  <li>b = 8 - 14/5. Multiply both 8 and 14 by 5.</li>
  <li>b = (40 - 14) / 5</li>
  <li>b = 26 / 5</li>
</ul>
</ul>
  <p>The result is y = (7/5)x + 26/5. Let's check using Desmos. Plot the line and the intercepts and see if they match up!</p>

          <strong>Example 3: Let's examine where slope-intercept may be applicable in the real world with the following application problem.</strong>
<p>A car rental agency charges a flat fee of $30 for renting a car, and an additional $15 per day. Write the equation in slope-intercept form that represents the total cost (y) of renting a car for x days.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px; font-family: Garamond, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;" id="example_three"></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 40px;">

                <button type="button" onclick="exampleThreeOnClick()">Next step</button>
  </p>   
   <strong>Solution:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Step 1: Identify the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) from the given information.
In this problem, the flat fee of $30 represents the y-intercept (b) because it is the cost when "x" (the number of days) is 0. The additional charge of $15 per day represents the slope (m) because it increases the cost by $15 for each additional day.</li>
              <li>Step 2: Write the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b).
The equation will be: y = 15x + 30.</li>
              <li>Result: the correct answer is y = 15x + 30.</li>
            </ul>

<p>Solving intercepts using equations, graphs, and tables involves finding the points where a function or equation intersects the x and y axes. Here's a summary of how to do it using each approach:

<h2>Equations:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>For the x-intercept, set y to zero (y = 0) and solve for the corresponding value(s) of x. This will give you the x-coordinate(s) of the point(s) where the graph crosses the x-axis.</li>
  <li>For the y-intercept, set x to zero (x = 0) and solve for the corresponding value of y. This will give you the y-coordinate of the point where the graph crosses the y-axis.</li>
</ul>
  <h2>Graphs:
<p>
  <ul>
<li>To find the x-intercept from a graph, locate the point(s) where the graph intersects the x-axis. The x-coordinate(s) of these point(s) represent the x-intercept(s).</li>
<li>To find the y-intercept from a graph, locate the point where the graph intersects the y-axis. The y-coordinate of this point represents the y-intercept.</li>
</ul>
  <h2>Tables:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>For the x-intercept, examine the table and find the row(s) where the corresponding y-value is zero (y = 0). The x-values in these rows represent the x-intercept(s). </li>
  <li>For the y-intercept, locate the row where the x-value is zero (x = 0). The corresponding y-value in this row represents the y-intercept. </li>
  <li>Solving intercepts is essential for understanding the behavior of functions and their graphical representations. It helps identify key points, such as the roots (zeros) of the equation and the starting point on the y-axis. By utilizing equations, graphs, or tables, mathematicians and scientists can gain valuable insights into various mathematical models and real-world scenarios. </li>
</ul>

<p>The following interactive examples will help you step through how to find an x and y-intercept using a graph, simple substitution, and a table of x and y values. Please proceed through the four examples and then complete the quiz for this module. 
  <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/finding-intercepts-equation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <strong>You can review intercepts and more examples via this free resource.</strong>

<h2>
  <strong>Example 1: You are given the following table of x and y values. How do you solve the x-intercept?
  <ul>

<style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
table.center {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
  </style>
 
<table alt="A table of x and y values from which we must solve the x-intercept.">
  <tr>
    <th>x</th>
    <th>y</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+48</td>
    <td>-30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+61</td>
    <td>-45</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>+74</td>
    <td>-60</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
  <strong>First, let's find emerging patterns in how x increments or decrements relative to y and express that as a rise over run fraction.
  <h3>
    <strong>Let's step it out:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We see that x increments and y decrements. x increments by 13 each time and y decrements by 15 each time. So we have our pattern!</li>
      <li>We could write this as -15/+13 with the change in y being our rise and the change in x being our run.</li>
    </ul>
  <BR>
   <strong>Now, let's step fill in the gaps in our table until y = 0. Remember, we will arrive at the x-intercept when y is 0:</strong>
   <ul>
    <li>You can click the button below to reveal the steps to find the x-intercept</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="padding-left: 40px; font-family: Garamond, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;" id="example_one"></p>

    <button type="button" onclick="exampleOnePrevClick()">Prev step </button>
    <button type="button" onclick="exampleOneOnClick()">Next step</button>
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: In order to move y towards 0, we need to work in the opposite direction. So we can add 15 to y and subtract 13 from x.</li>
      <li>Step 2: Let's add 15 to -30 and subtract 13 from 48. We get y = -15, x = 35.</li>
      <li>Step 3: Let's keep going. When y = 0, x = 22.</li>
      <li>Step 4: We arrived at 0 for y. Therefore, our x-intercept is (22, 0). Try graphing it on Desmos to confirm.</li>
    </ul>

    <BR>
      <strong>Example 2: Of course, if we have an equation, let's say: 2x + 5 = y, we can always populate our own table of values by plugging values and subsequently plot the result.</strong>
  <BR> 
  <p>
  <table alt="A table of x and y values from which we must solve the intercepts.">

  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  <BR>
  <ul>
          <li>We can see that as x increases by 1, y increases by 2. We can also see from his table that the y-intercept is (0, 5).</li>
          <li>We can then decrement to get the x-intercept (where y would equal 0).</li>
     </ul>
  <BR>
        <table alt="A table of x and y values from which we must solve the intercepts.">
  <tr>

<strong><p>Notice we need a half-step x to get y to equal 0. Let us step through what we just did in the second table to determine the x-intercept. Use the buttons below to cycle through the steps.</p></strong>

      <h3>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Step 1: To get the x-intercept, y must equal 0. So, we must decrement both x and y. Remember, as we subtract 1 from x, we must subtract 2 from y.</li>
          <li>Step 2: As we approach y = 0, you will notice we hit a problem with our y increment. There is no way to obtain y = 0 with a decrement of 2. So, we must opt for a half step, which means we must decrement x by 0.5. We are essentially halving each of our ranges.</li>

  </p>   
   <strong>Solution:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Step 1: Let's start with the x-intercept that would require y to be zero. That would give us -5x = 10.</li>
              <li>Step 2: Divide both sides by -5 to get the x-intercept: x = -2, so the x-intercept is (-2, 0).</li>
              <li>Step 3: Now, let's go after the y-intercept that would require x to be zero. -4y = 10.</li>
              <li>Step 4: Divide both sides by -4 to get the y-intercept. y = -2.5, so the y-intercept is (0, -2.5).</li>
              <li>Step 5: So, our x and y-intercepts are (-2, 0)(0, -2.5), respectively.</li>
